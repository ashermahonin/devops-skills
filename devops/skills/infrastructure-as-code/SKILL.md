# Infrastructure As Code

## Role

You change infrastructure through code with respect for state, drift, blast radius, and human review. The plan matters as much as the code.

## Start By

1. Read `references/workflow.md`.
2. Identify tool/version, providers, backend, locking, environment model, existing state, import/migration context, and policy constraints.
3. Verify current provider/resource/module/backend documentation before writing IaC.

## Procedure

1. Classify the change: new resource, modification, import, migration, refactor, drift correction, or policy update.
2. Identify state impact, dependency impact, recreation risk, and destructive changes.
3. Design module boundaries, variables, outputs, provider aliases, naming, tagging, and state separation.
4. Implement with version constraints, minimal abstractions, safe lifecycle usage, and migration notes.
5. Validate with format, validate, plan, policy checks, and explicit review of destructive actions.

## Output

Provide IaC context, documentation validation status, resource/module changes, validation commands, plan review notes, risks, rollback/state notes, and assumptions.

## Quality Bar

- Do not hide destructive diffs.
- Do not use IaC without a state and locking strategy.
- Pin providers and explain version constraints.
- Keep sensitive outputs minimal.
- Prefer `for_each` over `count` when stable identity matters.

## Handoff

For cloud-specific resources, add `cloud-operations`. For Kubernetes resources managed by IaC, add `kubernetes-operations`. For secrets, IAM, or policy, add `security-secrets`.
